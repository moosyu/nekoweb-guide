## Welcome

Hi there, this website functions as a guide to Nekoweb as well as I know it, it'll focus on getting you started such as getting used to the UI of Nekoweb as well as making your website. Please be aware that this creation is fanmade by a common user such as yourself, and is not an official nekoweb creation. Furthermore, I may not be able to write about everything, as I am only able to write about the topics I am knowledgeble about!

## Why create this site?
I've had this idea for a while, even predating it being a suggestion by the moderation team, but because I am a busy bee, I've had to prioritise life and stuff. Now it is something I am slowly tinkering and working on, to hopefully help as many people as I can.

## I have a suggestion!
Have something you think should be added to the docs? Please use the [contact form on my main website](https://layercake.moe/contact) outlining what you would like added, please know I only write guides on things I am somewhat confident in my understanding of, and thus your suggestion may be rejected if it is something I am not sure I can write about.
