description: The Unofficial Nekoweb Documentaton

## Welcome
Hi there, this website functions as a guide to Nekoweb as well as I know it. It'll focus on getting you started such as introductions to Nekoweb specific stuff as well as basics on making your website. Please be aware that this creation is fan-made by a common user such as yourself, and is not official documentation. Furthermore, I may not be able to write about everything, as I am only able to write about the topics I am knowledgeable about!
## Why create this site?
I've had this idea for a while, even predating it being a suggestion by the moderation team, but because I am a busy bee, I've had to prioritise life and stuff. I thought that having information publicly available rather than gated behind a discord server would mean more people would be able to customise aspects of their site that they previously would not have. I also think with this published it means people do not have to repeat themselves in regards to certain questions and instead have something to reference. This project is something I am slowly tinkering and working on, and is currently only managed by one admin, for this reason development and updates may be slow.
## I have a suggestion!
Have something you think should be added to the docs? Please use the [contact form on my main website](https://layercake.moe/contact) outlining what you would like added, please know I only write guides on things I am somewhat confident in my understanding of, and thus your suggestion may be rejected if it is something I am not sure I can write about.
## How can I help?
If you would like to add something (either to one of these topics or add something new), you can contact me on the Nekoweb discord, or by using my contact form but leaving a discord username that I can contact back to, to discuss what you'd like to add! In terms of addinng anything, <a href="https://github.com/fleuraward/nekoweb-guide">the repo for this page is public</a> in which you can submit a pull request!
